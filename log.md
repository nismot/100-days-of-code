**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: May 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working througth the HTML portion of the Front End Development Certification.

**Thoughts** A lot of this is review for me. Although its not always a bad thing to go back review some of the things that you may have forgotten about.

### Day 1: May 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still working througth the HTML portion of the Front End Development Certification. About 1/2 through it.

**Thoughts** Still a lot of it is review. Struggling with staying focused on some of the things that I already know. Really wanting to get to the Responsive Design with Bootstrap. Haven't touch responsive design in a long time. Will continue to push through the HTML pieces.

### Day 2: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Working on the Basic JavaScript course. About half way through the HTML course.

**Thoughts** Going to be switching between the HTML and JavaScript tutorials. HTML is more of review for me. JavaScripts is still something I never really picked up and should be more beneficial to do both.

### Day 3: May 15, Monday

### Day 5: May 19, Friday ###

**Today's Progress**: Working Through hour 4 of 'Sams Teach Yourself JavaScript in 24 Hours'

**Thoughts** Starting to notice that JavaScript kind of has a C++ feel to it. This is really nice because I started learning programming with C++ which I like a lot.
