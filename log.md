**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: May 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Working througth the HTML portion of the Front End Development Certification.

**Thoughts** A lot of this is review for me. Although its not always a bad thing to go back review some of the things that you may have forgotten about.

### Day 1: May 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Still working througth the HTML portion of the Front End Development Certification. About 1/2 through it.

**Thoughts** Still a lot of it is review. Struggling with staying focused on some of the things that I already know. Really wanting to get to the Responsive Design with Bootstrap. Haven't touch responsive design in a long time. Will continue to push through the HTML pieces.

### Day 2: May 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Working on the Basic JavaScript course. About half way through the HTML course.

**Thoughts** Going to be switching between the HTML and JavaScript tutorials. HTML is more of review for me. JavaScripts is still something I never really picked up and should be more beneficial to do both.

### Day 3: May 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Still working on JavaScript.Also working on this weeks RubyMotion Blog

**Thoughts** Think I going to enjoy learning JavaScript. Put it off for long enough.

### Day 4: May 15, Tuesday ###

**Today's Progress**: Working through hour 3 of 'Sams Teach Yourself JavaScript in 24 Hours'

**Thoughts** Did I mention I was doing JavaScript...

### Day 5: May 19, Friday ###

**Today's Progress**: Working Through hour 4 of 'Sams Teach Yourself JavaScript in 24 Hours'

**Thoughts** Starting to notice that JavaScript kind of has a C++ feel to it. This is really nice because I started learning programming with C++ which I like a lot.

### Day 6: June 3, Saturday ###

**Today's Progress**: Dug out some old CS homework to use as Ruby exercises.

**Thoughts** HW1: Merging numbers from 2 files then sort them ascending order using either selection sort, bubble sort, or insertion sort.
             HW1.1: Write a program that counts the number of characters, including spaces and new line characters, number of words, and number of lines in one file.
             HW1.2: Write a program that asks the user to enter customer information and saves the records into a file. Requirement,
                a) Ask the user to select either to enter new customer information or exit the program
                b) If the user selects enter new record, the program asks the user to enter the following information: first name, last name, social security number, and date of birth.
                c) You should use append method so that every time you run the program the old records wonâ€™t be removed.

### Day 7: June 7, Wednesday ###

**Today's Progress**: Back to working on Ruby. Working through "The Ruby Way" third edition. Internationalization chapter. Redoing old CS homework in Ruby.

**Thoughts** Need to really brush up on the text book terminology and concepts. This is needed for interviewing for Ruby jobs. 



-Starting over as much time has past since the last commit-


Day 0: August 9, Wednesday

Today's Progress: Starting with the basics. HTML and CSS on freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts** Its rough restarting with stuff that you learned a long time ago, but it is ofter needed. We spend a lot of time copy and pasting all over the place and tend to lose what is actually needing to be done. So I am starting from the very beginning...again.
